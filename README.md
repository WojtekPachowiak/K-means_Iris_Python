It'a a low level implementation: Scikit-learn is used only for importing iris dataset.

Choose 2 features (sepal or petal, width or length) and watch how k-means algorithms is converging. The visualization is made in matplotlib.

### Warning: the code runs very slowly.
### Warning2: the code is not representative of my current Python skills.
